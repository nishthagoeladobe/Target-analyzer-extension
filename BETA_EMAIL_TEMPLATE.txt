I'd like to invite you to beta test the Adobe Target Inspector Chrome extension.

This tool helps analyze Adobe Target implementations, detect activities, measure performance, and test prehiding snippet impact.


WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THIS VERSION:
===================================

✨ Professional navy blue design (enterprise-grade)
✨ 30% more compact and space-efficient
✨ Detects at.js & Alloy.js activities automatically
✨ Real-time performance analysis
✨ Prehiding snippet testing (WITH vs WITHOUT comparison)
✨ Works on strict CSP sites (Bank of America, Macy's, etc.)


INSTALLATION (5 MINUTES):
==========================

1. Download attached: adobe-target-inspector-beta.zip
2. Extract to a folder
3. Open Chrome → chrome://extensions/

See attached BETA_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.txt for detailed testing instructions.


FEEDBACK NEEDED:
